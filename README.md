# AdventureTime - NativeScript-Vue Application for Travel Sharing

A cross-platform full-stack mobile and web application built with NativeScript and Vue.
Utilising Google Firebase for database, authentication and storage.

My idea was to build a mobile app for a missing market segment to help people find adventures with friends or strangers and cut costs.
